Hi, my name is Luis Rosario and I am studying to be a software engineer. 
    One of my main goals is to build my first program in the form of a discord bot
    and grow my project portfolio over time with more ambitious and logically complex 
    applications.

    I am currently learning python to start off and over time I will look into more options for some experience in lower level programming.
